# BlockPuzzle

Welcome to Block Puzzle, a sliding number puzzle that will test your skill.

There are 13 different board sizes:

- 3x3
- 3x4
- 4x4
- 4x5
- 5x5
- 5x6
- 6x6
- 6x8
- 8x8
- 10x10
- 12x12
- 15x15
- 20x20

On each one, you will have one "hole" that you can use for moving the numbers around.

There are also color codes for which numbers are in the correct spot. A number is green when it is "solved".

Simply hit "New Game" on a board to get started! But be aware that the boards are randomly generated and thus some boards may be unsolvable - simply hit New Game again when you come across this problem where only two numbers are not in the correct position!

But enough talk - click [here](https://marblelover003.github.io/BlockPuzzle) to get started!
