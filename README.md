On each one, you will have one "hole" that you can use for moving the numbers around. See the image below if you're wondering what I mean by this.

There are also color codes for which numbers are in the correct spot. A number is green when it is "solved".

Simply hit "New Game" on a board to get started! But be aware that the boards are randomly generated and thus some boards may be unsolvable - if you come across this problem where only two numbers are not in their correct positions, you'll get a prompt that asks if you wish to start a new game.

This game is keyboard compatible too! Press <kbd>N</kbd> on your keyboard to start a new game, and use the arrow keys or the WASD keys to move the tiles! This feature was added in v1.4.0.
